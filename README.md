# TipsAndTricks

## Summary 

Hello from the Winter 2019 development team! We put together this document to help outline some information which we think would be helpful for you as you start at HubHead. The issues which we ran into before, and any information which we think would be beneficial will be located around this document. Hopefully, this information will help you with the onboarding process - good luck! 

## The Tech Stack 

* Spring (Java) 
* AngularJS 
* Angular 2.0 

These are the main technologies involved but we also have some microservices to handle particular parts of the application. There are some common terms which are thrown around which would be useful to remember

## Microservices and Important Terminology

### Bonita 

Bonitasoft is the software which we use to handle the **workflows**. For a quick definition, workflows are the sequence of industrial, administrative, or other processes through which a piece of work passes from initiation to completion. 

In our CloudSolution, we handle various sequences for *Adding Equipment*, *Modifying Equipment*, *Adding Functional Locations*, *Modifying Functional Locations*, *Adding Material*, *Modifying Material*, etc. The information for these processes flow through bonita.
